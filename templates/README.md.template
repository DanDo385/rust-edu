# Lab NN - [Topic Name]

## What You're Building (Plain English)

[2-3 sentences explaining in simple terms what this lab is about. Avoid jargon.]

Think of this as [analogy to understand it]. You'll [main action] so you can [goal].

## New Rust Concepts in This Lab

- **[Concept 1]**: [One-sentence explanation]. Unlike [other languages], Rust [advantage].
- **[Concept 2]**: [One-sentence explanation]. This prevents [class of bugs].
- **[Concept 3]**: [One-sentence explanation]. [Why it matters].

## Rust Syntax You'll See

```rust
// Syntax example 1
// Explanation: [what this does]
let x = value;

// Syntax example 2
// Explanation: [what this does]
let result = function(param);

// Syntax example 3
// Explanation: [what this does]
fn name(param: Type) -> ReturnType {
    // body
}
```

## How to Run

```bash
# Run the main binary (executes src/main.rs)
cargo run -p [package-name]

# Run the tests (checks your implementation)
cargo test -p [package-name]

# Run tests with output visible
cargo test -p [package-name] -- --nocapture

# Check if code compiles without running
cargo check -p [package-name]

# Format your code
cargo fmt -p [package-name]
```

## The Exercises

You'll implement [N] functions:

1. **function_name**: [One-line description]
   - Learn about: [Concept 1], [Concept 2]
   - Example: [input] → [output]

2. **another_function**: [One-line description]
   - Learn about: [Concept]
   - Example: [input] → [output]

3. **(Optional) third_function**: [Description]
   - Learn about: [Concept]
   - Stretch goal: [Challenge]

## Solution Explanation (No Code - Just Ideas)

**function_name**:
- [Plain English explanation of approach]
- [What Rust mechanism is used here]
- [Why it matters]

**another_function**:
- [Explanation]

## Where Rust Shines

**Compared to JavaScript:**
```javascript
// JavaScript version
function functionName(input) {
    // [code]
    return result;
}

// Issues:
// - No type checking
// - Unclear what types expected
// - Can pass wrong types without error
```

**Compared to Python:**
```python
# Python version
def function_name(input: Type) -> ReturnType:
    # [code]
    return result

# Issues:
# - Type hints are optional
# - No compile-time checking
# - Errors happen at runtime
```

**Rust version:**
```rust
pub fn function_name(input: Type) -> ReturnType {
    // [code]
    result
}

// Advantages:
// - Type is mandatory and checked at compile time
// - Impossible to pass wrong types
// - No runtime type errors
// - Compiler catches bugs before runtime
```

**Why this matters:**
- [Specific advantage of Rust approach]
- [Performance benefit]
- [Safety benefit]

## Common Beginner Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

1. **[Mistake 1 Title]**
   ```rust
   // ❌ WRONG:
   let x = value;  // Error: [specific error message]
   ```
   **Fix:** [How to fix it]
   ```rust
   // ✅ CORRECT:
   let x = correct_value;
   ```
   **Why it happens:** [Explanation of why beginners make this mistake]

2. **[Mistake 2 Title]**
   ```rust
   // ❌ WRONG:
   function_with_error(param);
   ```
   **Fix:** [How to fix it]
   **Why it happens:** [Explanation]

3. **[Mistake 3 Title]**
   - [Description of mistake]
   - **Fix:** [Solution]
   - **Why it happens:** [Explanation]

## Memory Model (Optional - only if relevant)

### At a High Level
[Conceptual explanation without too much detail]

### Under the Hood
[How Rust actually manages memory for this]

### In Memory Terms
```
Stack:                      Heap:
┌─────────────┐
│ variable: T │─────────▶ [actual data on heap if applicable]
│ ptr: 0x1000 │
│ len: 5      │
└─────────────┘
```

## Symbol Deep Dive (Optional - only if relevant)

### The `&` Symbol (Borrow Operator)
- **What it means**: Take a reference, not ownership
- **In this context**: [How it's used in this lab]
- **Example**: `&String` means "borrowed String"
- **Common misconception**: [What people get wrong]

### The `mut` Keyword
- **What it means**: Make a variable mutable (changeable)
- **In this context**: [How it's used]
- **Example**: `let mut x = 5;`
- **Common misconception**: [What people get wrong]

### The `->` Operator
- **What it means**: "returns this type"
- **In this context**: Specifies return type of functions
- **Example**: `fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 { ... }`

## Stretch Goals

Once you've completed the basic exercises, try these challenges:

1. **[Stretch 1]**: [Description]
   - Learn about: [New concept]
   - Hint: [Helpful pointer]

2. **[Stretch 2]**: [Description]
   - Learn about: [New concept]
   - Hint: [Helpful pointer]

3. **[Stretch 3]**: [Description]
   - Learn about: [New concept]

## What's Next?

After completing this lab, you'll move to **Lab NM: [Next Topic]**, where you'll learn about [preview of next concept]. Understanding [current concept] is essential before diving into [next concept].

## Testing Checklist

Before you submit, make sure:

- [ ] `cargo test` passes all tests
- [ ] `cargo check` compiles without errors
- [ ] `cargo run` executes without panicking
- [ ] Code is formatted with `cargo fmt`
- [ ] You understand what every test is checking
- [ ] You can explain each function to someone else

## Learning Tips

1. **Read the tests first** - They show exactly what the function should do
2. **Use `cargo test` often** - Tests give you immediate feedback
3. **Check `solution.rs`** - If stuck, read the exhaustive explanations
4. **Try stretch goals** - They deepen your understanding
5. **Compare with other languages** - Section above shows Rust's advantages

Good luck! Remember: read the comments in `solution.rs` - every line is explained! 🦀
